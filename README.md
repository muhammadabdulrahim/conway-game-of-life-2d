# Conway's Game of Life 2D

![2D View][thumbnail]

A Unity implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in 2D space. Users can adjust speed of the simulation, set if simulation should be automatic, adjust grid size, manually specify starting block locations, and set if simulation should begin in a randomized state.

I also worked on a [3D implementation](https://github.com/muhammadabdulrahim/conway-game-of-life-3d).
